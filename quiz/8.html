            <p>You've learned a lot about digital privacy today.</p>
            <p>
                <a class="show q1">What can apps track about us?</a>
                <span class="hidden q1">
                    Pretty much everything we do, from our location to our all of our Internet activities.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="hidden q1">
                <a class="show q2">Why do they track all of this information?</a>
                <span class="hidden q2">
                    Apps can sell this information to advertisers, making billions off of you. 
                    Advertisers love having more information to target their ads and make even more money.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="hidden q2">
                <a class="show q3">Why does it matter?</a>
                <span class="hidden q3">
                    Apps and advertisers without your best interests at heart can learn and exploit all kinds of information about you, even really personal information.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="hidden q3">
                No matter what, we think privacy is really important. It's what stops the rest of the world from knowing the things we'd rather keep to ourselves. In fact, it's a fundamental human right.
            </p>
            <p class="hidden q3">
                Personally, we like to remember this saying: <emph>"If the service is free, you're the product."</emph>
                Apps and advertisers don't always have our best interests at heart, and that's why we encourage you
                to think about ways to protect your digital privacy, in a way that fits your life.
